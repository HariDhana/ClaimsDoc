## Introducing role-based views

The most significant change in the all-new Claims is the introduction of role-based views - My View and Admin View.

To improve accessibility and ease of use, features and functionality frequently used by all users in the organization are grouped under My View. Organizational, admin-level functionalities used by select users are now under the Admin View.

In other words, My View allows users to manage their individual travel and expense management within the organization. Admin View allows admins to configure, customize, automate, and control overall spend in the organization.

## My view

My View is a view available for all users in the organization that is dedicated to their individual travel, expense reporting and approval functions, and more. All functionalities and information you see in this view, pertain to your individual business travel and expense management within the organization.

Within each module in My View, a list of your pending tasks is shown prominently. This helps you to easily stay on top of your business travel and expenses any time and all the time.
