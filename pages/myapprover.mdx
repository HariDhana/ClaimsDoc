The main purpose of advances is to provide employees with upfront funds before expenses are incurred. Employees request advances to cover anticipated expenses that they will encounter during upcoming business activities, such as travel, projects, or events. Advances offer financial assistance to employees, ensuring they have sufficient funds to fulfill their duties and responsibilities without incurring personal expenses.
